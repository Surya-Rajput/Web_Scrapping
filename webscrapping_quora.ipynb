Here in Toronto, that means to afford a two-bedroom apartment, you should make about $113,000 a year. The average person in Toronto makes about $39,000 a year, so doing the math, you would need three people making the average to find that apartment \\u201caffordable\\u201d.\\n\\nAs of March 2022, the average rent among all apartments, country wide, was $1,818. Using the \\u201c30% rule\\u201d, you should make $72,720 a year. The average salary in Canada is $59,000 (yes, the large number of low wage workers in Toronto drives its average down)\\n\\nSo, how many people in Canada could afford a two-bedroom in Toronto on one salary? About 10%.\\n\\nIs it that bad. No. There\\u2019s a lot of rent control in Canada so some people are \\u201clocked in\\u201d, but it does mean they have no chance of moving out or up. It\\u2019s one of the big obstacles to people moving to different parts of the country for work.\\n\\nWould buying help? Not a chance. The average home price in the country is $650,000, and don\\u2019t expect to find a house in that price range in the City of Toronto (except maybe a small condo, and that most likely means your maintenance fees will be $1,000 a month). So, assuming you can save up $130,000 for a down payment (good luck with that). For that, you would need an income of $91,000 to qualify. If the house price is just a tad over $1 million, you can\\u2019t get a guaranteed loan for that, so your interest rate goes up sharply.\\n\\nThe main problem is a lack of rental units, which pretty much stopped being built in most of the country in the 1980s in favour of condos. The addition of new rental units in the last 40 years or so has been glacial. This isn\\u2019t some problem with rent control - on most land in Canada, municipal law prohibits apartment buildings unless they have massive amounts of parking around them. In some areas, you can\\u2019t build them at all. There are often requirements to have unused \\u201cgreen space\\u201d around them as well, which is completely underutilized.\\n\\nPlaces with plentiful rental units, like Montreal (and most of the rest of Quebec) and Hamilton, Ontario, tend to be more reasonable. However, population pressure from fast growing cities like Vancouver and Toronto drives up prices around them.\\n\\nHere in Toronto, the most affordable community within commuting distance is Brock. I had to look up where it was. Here\\u2019s how you get there\\n\\nYes, it\\u2019s 80 minutes away and there\\u2019s no direct freeway to it. There\\u2019s no regional transit there either. Houses there average about $770,000.\\n\\nYes, you can find a house in Ontario for just over $300,000. In Thunder Bay.\\n\\nYeah, just over 14 hours. Here\\u2019s how far you can drive in 14 hours from Toronto in the other direction.\\n\\nThe irony is that Atlanta probably isn\\u2019t that much more expensive than Thunder Bay. Yeah, I looked it up and it\\u2019s about $380,000 US, which is about $500,000 Cdn. Still cheaper than Toronto though.\\n\\nZoning is the primary problem. It\\u2019s not \\u201cwe must pave more agricultural land\\u201d it\\u2019s \\u201cCanada\\u2019s cities were built around cars and most of the land was wasted.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s the population density map of the GTA. Note the part near the lakeshore, which has heavy rail commuter trains, is often less heavily populated than nearby areas.\\n\\nBut let\\u2019s look at some shopping centers\\n\\nToronto Eaton Centre, right downtown, is in a massively dense area. It has parking, but it\\u2019s paid and inside the building.\\n\\nScarborough Town Centre, in the inner suburbs, has big parking lots, but the buildings (a mix of a mall and municipal buildings) cover a lot of the site. it used to be on the now closed Line 3, but there will be a subway stop here in the 2030s.\\n\\nVaughan Metropolitan Center in an outer suburb is mostly surface parking, a mix of paid parking for the nearby subway station and free parking for the stores. Yes, it\\u2019s on the subway too.\\n\\nThe sort of low density development you see in Vaughan just isn\\u2019t sustainable, but it\\u2019s going to be difficult to undo years of car centric policies, but it can be done.\\n\\nYears ago, Montreal closed a section of Rue St. Catherine, it\\u2019s primary commercial street, to traffic in front of the Place Des Arts. It was a big hit and drew more people to the area, including the nearby Chinatown, which also has traffic restrictions. More recently, particularly during summer, the city has been closing more streets to traffic, turning them into pedestrian malls. You can do this without a lot of disruption to traffic, which just goes around. You can have more dense housing as long as they don\\u2019t all need a car, and they won\\u2019t need a car if they can walk, bike or take transit to where they need to go. That\\u2019s the solution.\", \"upvoteCount\": 204, \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/Do-you-agree-that-there-is-a-housing-crisis-in-Canada-as-Canadian-Prime-Minister-Justin-Trudeau-suggested-during-his-retreat-in-London-Ontario?top_ans=1477743696964150\"}, {\"@type\": \"Answer\", \"author\": {\"@type\": \"Person\", \"agentInteractionStatistic\": {\"@type\": \"InteractionCounter\", \"interactionType\": \"http://schema.org/ReplyAction\", \"userInteractionCount\": 17303}, \"description\": \"I have lived in Vancouver, Burnaby, Coquitlam, Victoria, Golden, Toronto, TBay\", \"image\": \"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-29340431-100-bPdeuLqJfTpfezbbwGsrn6ob4e1BSU3X.jpeg\", \"interactionStatistic\": {\"@type\": \"InteractionCounter\", \"interactionType\": \"http://schema.org/FollowAction\", \"userInteractionCount\": 2287}, \"knowsAbout\": \"Canada\", \"name\": \"Philip Allingham\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/profile/Philip-Allingham-1\"}, \"dateCreated\": \"2023-05-30T04:19:28.207642+00:00\", \"parentItem\": {\"@type\": \"Comment\", \"text\": \"Why is Justin Trudeau allowing a lot of foreigners to immigrate and live in all of Ontario, Canada, during a great deal of housing shortages including more than average house rent for low incomers?\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Justin-Trudeau-allowing-a-lot-of-foreigners-to-immigrate-and-live-in-all-of-Ontario-Canada-during-a-great-deal-of-housing-shortages-including-more-than-average-house-rent-for-low-incomers\"}, \"text\": \"Justin Trudeau is powerless to do anything without the cooperation of at least one opposition party.

That\\u2019s strictly within the jurisdiction of the provinces, and they largely let municipalities set their own rules.\\n\\nAs such, the kind of buildings that make for dense walkable neighbourhoods with services close by are illegal to build in most of the country. Here in Toronto, for example, new apartment buildings and commercial uses are crammed into narrow strips next to large arterial roads. Everything else is single family homes on large lots.\\n\\nThis is Willowdale (near where I work) - Yonge Street between Sheppard Avenue and Finch Avenue, right along a subway line. As you can see, Yonge Street has a lot of office buildings, condos, apartment buildings and commercial uses, but go 200m away from Yonge and it\\u2019s all single family homes. This is typical development in Toronto.\\n\\nNow, here in Ontario, the provincial government has allowed municipalities to have denser zoning. The thing is, they refuse to do it because it\\u2019s unpopular with people who are likely to vote in municipal elections. Two people, the Mayor of Toronto and the York Region Chair, have the power to overrule council if fewer than 66% of them turn down a rezoning application. They\\u2019re unlikely to use that power.\\n\\nThis strip is a good example of what, 40 years ago, was a typical suburban arterial road with low density development. However, attempts to take it \\u201cthe next step\\u201d, which are supported by most local residents and the area\\u2019s councilor, have not found favour at city council. As such, this densely packed area is cut in two by a six-lane arterial road. I have to cross that street from time to time and there are certain places I won\\u2019t even attempt to cross because of turning traffic. There was a proposal to narrow the road to four lanes (which is the width of the street a couple of kilometers south) and to add a bike lane and wider sidewalks. It didn\\u2019t get any support because many people who don\\u2019t live in the area drive through it to get to the nearby 401 highway.\\n\\nAs such, it doesn\\u2019t matter how much money the federal government pours into the problem - the types of buildings it needs to built to make housing affordable and cost effective can\\u2019t be built anywhere in the city or anywhere near it. In addition, people like me who live in densely packed areas are actually subsidizing people who live in spread out suburbs, at all three levels of government. There\\u2019s no incentive for people in suburbs to encourage denser development, which results in more tax revenue, because they don\\u2019t bear the full burden of that tax deficit - downtown dwellers do.\", \"upvoteCount\": 257, \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/Do-you-agree-that-there-is-a-housing-crisis-in-Canada-as-Canadian-Prime-Minister-Justin-Trudeau-suggested-during-his-retreat-in-London-Ontario?top_ans=1477743630480584\"}, {\"@type\": \"Answer\", \"author\": {\"@type\": \"Person\", \"affiliation\": {\"@type\": \"CollegeOrUniversity\", \"name\": \"Concordia University, Montreal\"}, \"agentInteractionStatistic\": {\"@type\": \"InteractionCounter\", \"interactionType\": \"http://schema.org/ReplyAction\", \"userInteractionCount\": 1029}, \"description\": \"studied at Concordia University, Montreal\", \"image\": \"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-57262029-100-mjjmqhmrakpzybtfuqyguqufmhgazfzw.jpeg\", \"interactionStatistic\": {\"@type\": \"InteractionCounter\", \"interactionType\": \"http://schema.org/FollowAction\", \"userInteractionCount\": 55}, \"name\": \"Geoff Reid\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/profile/Geoff-Reid-1\"}, \"dateCreated\": \"2024-02-26T10:44:28.051670+00:00\", \"parentItem\": {\"@type\": \"Comment\", \"text\": \"How can Trudeau actually be fighting the housing crisis if he increased the number of immigrants he brings in?\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/How-can-Trudeau-actually-be-fighting-the-housing-crisis-if-he-increased-the-number-of-immigrants-he-brings-in\"}, \"text\": \"The Age old question.

However Harper and co. did nothing.\\n\\nNow comes Trudeau he starts to adress the demographics issue because come 2017 a McDonald\\u2019s in Quebec of all places, and rural Quebec where the unemployment rate is historically double digits, shuts due to lack of staff. The demand for housing does create new housing starts.\\n\\nNow Covid, and that changed everything, mass retirements, people leaving the work force to re-educate themselves. Now everywhere is understaffed. Housing takes a massive hit, Covid regulations shut down and the slow housing projects. Fewer workers to work on those causes contnued slow down, and now higger interesr rates, make the projects more expensive. Not to mention shortage of Materials(hard to finish a house when windows are 9 months on back order)\\n\\nBut we still have a Demographic crisis, don\\u2019t believe me? Canada accepted about 1M immigrants, while the economy was slowing and there was a minimal uptick in jobless numbers. Quebec is paying people $750/week to take construction courses because its that bad.\\n\\nSo before you complain that Trudeau is letting too many people in, realise that the economy still needs these people in every industry, especially constrution.\\n\\nBy shutting off the tap of newcomers, the housing crisis will slowly come to an end, but in that time the vacant job issue will rise, until you repeat the cycle.\\n\\nGetting angry at municipalities and saying common,sense will fix all problems isnt going to magically fix these issues.\", \"upvoteCount\": 62, \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/Do-you-agree-that-there-is-a-housing-crisis-in-Canada-as-Canadian-Prime-Minister-Justin-Trudeau-suggested-during-his-retreat-in-London-Ontario?top_ans=1477743741925747\"}, {\"@type\": \"Answer\", \"author\": {\"@type\": \"Person\", \"agentInteractionStatistic\": {\"@type\": \"InteractionCounter\", \"interactionType\": \"http://schema.org/ReplyAction\", \"userInteractionCount\": 2466}, \"description\": \"Pappenheimer-knowing guy (2018-present)\", \"hasOccupation\": {\"@type\": \"Role\", \"roleName\": \"Pappenheimer-knowing guy\", \"startDate\": \"2018\"}, \"image\": \"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-15890498-100-5jisfJOcQPzT5iZwUkggf5vl4Si1VR8O.jpeg\", \"interactionStatistic\": {\"@type\": \"InteractionCounter\", \"interactionType\": \"http://schema.org/FollowAction\", \"userInteractionCount\": 578}, \"name\": \"Erik Lund\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/profile/Erik-Lund-1\"}, \"dateCreated\": \"2021-02-06T20:06:52.650846+00:00\", \"image\": [{\"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"contentUrl\": \"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-086e2195939f4fa8b524d0395159b607-lq\"}, {\"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"contentUrl\": \"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cbff88018ecfd2e3da00a30c61dd73f4-pjlq\"}, {\"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"contentUrl\": \"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0962c4cac51bfa5b620764dd58777260-pjlq\"}, {\"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"contentUrl\": \"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-af61cd1018f43ae82a991b02ddf8fe2a-lq\"}], \"parentItem\": {\"@type\": \"Comment\", \"text\": \"Is there a housing crisis in Canada like there is in the UK?\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-housing-crisis-in-Canada-like-there-is-in-the-UK\"}, \"text\": \"Dude.

[1]\\n\\nA plumber makes $60,450. [2]\\n\\nOther workers, such as computer engineers, earn somewhat more at $67,418. [3]\\n\\nNow, let us look at the \\u201cpublic sector\\u201d:\\n\\nA teacher earns $48,750 with a high of $81,228. [4]\\n\\nA nurse earns $72,935 with a high of $83,168. [5]\\n\\nA police officer earns $93,275 with a high of $120,000. [6]\\n\\nMembers of Parliament earn $194,600.\\n\\nDoes anybody not see a problem?\\n\\nSupposedly, we live in a capitalistic society where it is all about free marketing, and yet, we have \\u201cpublic servants\\u201d who make more in a single shift than what many millions of Canadians will make in an entire week.\\n\\nAdditionally, whereas most private sector workers do not benefit from pensions, healthcare etc. public sector workers not only get all these things \\u2014 which are not included in their raw salary \\u2014 some of these public workers, such as police officers, also receive a housing downpayment as a bonus just for joining in the first place.\\n\\nHere is a baffling statement that I read a few years ago by Tom Stamatakis \\u2014 a former Vancouver police officer and current president of the Ottawa-based Canadian Police Association \\u2014 regarding the depression/suicide rate for cops:\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s not really attractive when what we\\u2019re saying is: \\u2018Hey, come and be a police officer. We don\\u2019t have enough resources, we\\u2019re in a crisis in terms of mental health and wellness, and you can make the same or more money if you go into other sectors.\\u201d [7]\\n\\nSo, tell me, Mister Stamatakis, could you enlighten me as to which jobs were paying more than a police officer?\\n\\nMaybe a brain surgeon or a psychiatrist, but even they have to spend four years in university, four in medical school, and complete a residency.\\n\\nAs shown above, even nurses \\u2014 who require a university degree, unlike police officers \\u2014 get paid less.\\n\\nI am not certain if this is deliberate deception on the part of Stamatakis, or complete delusion, but it is a trend I have observed to be very widespread, with police officers moaning about how underpaid they are, while earning far more than many medical professionals, as well as getting about as much pay in a single shift as your average retail worker might get in a week.\\n\\nAnd keep in mind, every salary increase a police officer gets means that the private sector classes \\u2014 many of whom are struggling to get even basic employment \\u2014 are earning less.\\n\\nThe likes of Stamatakis are effectively insinuating that they want the rest of Canadian society to be paid less, so that police officers can be paid more \\u2014 and thus secure their upper-class status while the rest of their countrymen continue to sink lower into despair until they are left destitute, homeless, in jail, or death on the street, the last category being a fate that befalls thousands of Canadians per year.\\n\\nIn the majority of cases, police officers with whom I have discussed this matter with \\u2014 both in the real world and online \\u2014 will resort to gaslighting tactics, and emotional manipulation if they even acknowledge this reality, but once in a while a law enforcement officer manages to impress me by being brutally honest.\\n\\nOn September 3, 2023, a Colorado police officer who spoke about fighting for higher wages for police officers back in his day, and when I brought up the consequences of this for the public, this is what he said \\u2014 and note that the quotation marks are him speaking from his perspective, not my own:\\n\\nhttps://www.quora.com/Should-we-defund-the-police-or-defend-the-police/answer/Ralph-Maher?__nsrc__=4&amp;__snid3__=58147799352&amp;comment_id=357693359&amp;comment_type=2\\nQuite disgustingly, the police \\u2014 unlike what the likes of Stamatakis claim \\u2014 are paid so generously, that in almost every Canadian city, more tax money is invested in the police alone than public parks, education, youth social programmes, paramedic services, and public transits and homeless shelters COMBINED! [8]\\n\\nEven more ironic, is that the police keep fighting for inflated wages while making a career out of a job that is literally centred on destroying other people\\u2019s social and economic lives.\\n\\nDon\\u2019t believe me?\\n\\nLet\\u2019s take a look at a practice called \\u2018carding\\u2019, which Ontario police were particularly notorious for doing.\\n\\nMore or less, \\u2018carding\\u2019 would give people who committed no crimes a criminal record \\u2014 and what was worse, is that there was no grounds of appeal, because it was not regarded as a conviction.\\n\\nIn addition, those who ever received a medical diagnosis of any sort would also get a similar record, because the perception among police is that people with autism, schizophrenia, bipolar etc. are \\u201cdangerous\\u201d and so should be thus treated as such.\\n\\nIn all, the policy of more or less criminalising people based on their disability, skin colour, and economic background became so commonplace that in Ontario alone, over four million people \\u2014 out of a working population of just over ten million \\u2014 had a criminal record of such, despite never being convicted, or even charged for anything.\\n\\nCould you imagine not only the economic, but health impact that would have come about for somebody who came under \\u201cpolice suspicion\\u201d for being Native American, an immigrant, homeless, or being \\u201csocially different\\u201d?\\n\\nAs one can see, it is kind of hard to sympathise with the likes of Stamatakis, who I am certain showed little concern for the types of policing he was himself once a part of.\\n\\nHe complains about burnout and mental health issues for police officers, yet apparently is oblivious, or does not care that these extra fundings he is calling for would come at the expense of everybody else, who are also struggling with economic and mental stress to a far greater extent \\u2014 including the people they chose to socially and economically stigmatise for one reason or another.\\n\\nPolice officers are complaining about how \\u201cthankless\\u201d their jobs are?\\n\\nIf they do not like their environment, they can resign right now and go find a job working as a cashier at a gas station, or a line cook in a restaurant, on a quarter of their current wages, with no proper health plan and pension, where they can have all the \\u201cthankless\\u201d customers and managers in the world.\\n\\nThis answer is not intended to be police-focused, but I felt the need to bring them up in this section of my answer for three reasons:\\n\\n * They enforce the very laws that can negatively impact everybody else\\n * They are the wards of the state, and how well they follow point one is dependent on how compensated they are \\u2014 even if these laws are designed to segregate/destroy other portions of the population\\n * They are paid far more than just about any other profession \\u2014 contrary to their lies of working on \\u201chumble wages\\u201d\\nOnce we all begin to see a real image of what the country\\u2019s working wages are really like, and the struggles people at the bottom of the economic barrel in particular go through, then a more realistic budget for \\u201cpublic\\u201d workers can be sought.\\n\\nSocial stigma\\n\\nAs mentioned in the previous section, \\u2018carding\\u2019, as well as the legal ostracisation of the physically and mentally disabled population causes a major stigma.\\n\\nNot only are the people in the latter group more likely to deal with verbal and/or physical abuse in their personal lives \\u2014 thus making it that much more difficult for them to mentally and physically function to full capacity \\u2014 being branded by employers and the state alike in the employment sector not only keeps such people more or less permanently in the lowest paying jobs, it also destroy their self-esteem to the point where many develop PTSD, and thus cannot do much more even if circumstances were to change.\\n\\nFor instance, the policy of \\u2018carding\\u2019 and unregulated discrimination against the disabled was declared unlawful by the Governor-General a few years ago, and while this may give future generations who fall under these categories a better opportunity, for many of those who spent the first years or even decades of their working lives with this unwarranted sting, the damage is already done, and no legislation is going to undo the economic, mental, and social imbalances that will come with it.\\n\\nThis leaves a large chunk of the population dejected and unmotivated.\\n\\nHardly a promising framework for our society.\\n\\nMental health\\n\\nMental health is a vital asset that individuals require for effective functioning, not only for themselves, but for others.\\n\\nWith the billions of dollars already spent on healthcare, imagine if we were able to honestly slash even a billion dollars a year from this budget \\u2014 and by \\u2018honest\\u2019, I mean because people\\u2019s physical and mental well-being improves so much that they no longer require these services, as opposed to some overpaid public sector worker wanting to fill more of their pockets.\\n\\nThis would also mean a billion dollars spent on other services, paying off national debt, or even lowering taxes, especially for the lower working classes.\\n\\nMeanwhile, we may actually see a lower rate of offending, meaning that we would be able to honestly slash the police, court, and prison budgets and have the same effect that reducing healthcare budgets would.\\n\\nIn addition, those who suffer from negative mental health conditions \\u2014 either because of social causation deposits (mental illness caused by low economic status) or downward drift theory (mental illness triggering lower economic social status) \\u2014 are more likely to be imprisoned later in life.\\n\\nThis can also include those who were bullied from youth, suffer a medical diagnosis \\u2014 often caused by bullying \\u2014 who are more or less left to their own devices, and never in a good way.\\n\\nTom Stamatakis \\u2014 like many cops I have seen complaining online and in the real world \\u2014 believes that police officers are suffering \\u201cburnout\\u201d, despite being better compensated than just about anybody else, because of the number of people they have to arrest?\\n\\nStart by being more selective as to what laws are worth prosecuting, and take the economic, social, and mental well-being of the rest of the population \\u2014 including those who do get arrested/imprisoned \\u2014 and you would not have to deal with all of this in the first place.\\n\\nAnd better yet, next time the police see an increase in their annual budget \\u2014 such as the Ottawa police demanding an extra $17 per taxpayer to pay for their wage increase, or about an hour\\u2019s worth of labour in the retail sector \\u2014 in order to combat \\u201cburnout\\u201d why not keep their inflated wages the same and hire more police to meet their \\u201cstrained\\u201d resources?\\n\\nI know it sounds logical, but at this time, the state and its representatives do not cater to this mindset, because they actually get their power off the desperation of those they claim they are \\u201cserving\\u201d.\\n\\nEducation\\n\\nI am not necessarily talking about improving people\\u2019s knowledge base, even though it is no doubt always a positive to see somebody wanting to improve their skillset in literature, mathematics, history, geography, languages, music, or applied science.\\n\\nWhat I am speaking about is the role of education from an economic, social, and mental health point of view.\\n\\nEver since my school days, people would always preach about the benefits of education, and how they would earn more money etc..\\n\\nWhat they did not tell students \\u2014 especially those from a lower income, or even those who struggle in a mortar classroom, but do well at the local library \\u2014 was that learning was not something that could only be obtained by spending tens of thousands of dollars in tuition fees, but rather, through something called autodidactism.\\n\\nFor certain hand-skill works that are less practical to learn through books, published articles, and documentaries, the needs for some trade school, college, or university may make some sense.\\n\\nNobody needs to go to university to learn history, read the works of William Shakespeare, or even gender studies.\\n\\nThese are all fields that can be learned through independent research.\\n\\nAn aspiring neurosurgeon should probably still go through residential training like anybody else, and perhaps even some formal medical school beforehand, depending on what they get in their pre-written test.\\n\\nHowever, it should NOT be a mandatory requirement for an aspiring physician to get an undergraduate degree beforehand, because these degrees can be related to any major, including those that will never be needed for the career in question \\u2014 in fact, many if not most medical schools specifically discourage undergraduates from taking a science-related major during this phase of their \\u201ceducation\\u201d.\\n\\nNot only does this mean more years spent in university \\u2014 which would end up causing these medical professionals to demand a bigger payment on their salaries upon entering the workforce \\u2014 such an obstacle could also discourage those who may prove themselves to be very high-quality medical professionals, because their economic situation may not be able to take losing eleven years of their income to a job they may not end up getting, especially if they are told to take a four-year degree to qualify for medical school, which turns away 90% of applicants.\\n\\nA person from a high-income family who has the support of their parents and close family members to see them through those formal years, and who would still be there for them in the event things do not go according to plan can risk taking on such a timely and costly investment.\\n\\nSomebody from a low economic background cannot do this.\\n\\nAnd I am not only discussing the healthcare industry but even other careers, such as teaching, computer programming, lawyers, counselling, journalism etc., which should all require little to no formal education to perform adequately.\\n\\nIf somebody really does not have the skill set to meet a certain career goal, then they should not be hired.\\n\\nI am not saying that candidates should not have the necessary requirements needed for the job, but I am saying that a piece of paper should neither be the only, nor preferred option.\\n\\nThis approach would also encourage those who feel perpetually at the lowest end of the employment sector to rise up, and it would also discourage universities from jacking up their tuitions, because these institutions would be once again regarded as a place of learning, as opposed to an investment opportunity.\\n\\nIn Canada, an average student will spend $50,000 on average for a four-year degree \\u2014 not including subsidised fees through taxes.\\n\\nWhat if that same amount of money was instead used for work-related opportunities \\u2014 either by giving employers resources for job training that would also allow candidates to receive a meagre salary on the side until their training period is completed, or even by encouraging startup businesses as an alternative, or giving extra income for those who work in a recognised non-profit organisation, in addition to basic welfare.\\n\\nThe vast majority of students do not go to university because they want to, they go there because they feel they have no other choice in order to \\u201cget ahead\\u201d.\\n\\nBy diverting the majority of this income back to the employment sector \\u2014 as it had been before \\u2014 not only would Canadians save billions of dollars annually, they would also be able to get into the workforce earlier, not have any student debt, and also be employed based on their skills, and not their connections, thus reducing the generational gaps that have plagued our country for decades.\\n\\nIdeology\\n\\nThis is probably the most complicated of the five major points, but also the most important.\\n\\nHow should our society function?\\n\\nShould we go more to the left and spend more through taxes.\\n\\nShould we go to the right and conserve ourselves?\\n\\nLet\\u2019s start with the left.\\n\\nMany have a particularly radical view of things: they more or less believe that everything should be state provided \\u2014 from basic essentials, to mindless entertainment.\\n\\nI myself do not go this far, as I have always believed in a free market for non-essential products \\u2014 bar a few possible exceptions \\u2014 and state regulation for those that are essential, either for one\\u2019s physical livelihood, or as a basic human right.\\n\\nBut since I have spoken on this topic quite a few times, I am not going to delve too far into this under this answer, which is focused on the causes and possible resolution behind the current housing crisis.\\n\\nQuite ironically, despite all their pretensions of wanting a \\u201cfree market\\u201d, the right actually manages to annoy me even more on this issue than the left.\\n\\nAt least with the left, there is no pretending that they believe in state regulation over a free market.\\n\\nPublic sector workers \\u2014 almost all of whom make far more money than all but the wealthiest of private sector workers \\u2014 will scream about how the government does not \\u201cowe anything\\u201d to a homeless person who may have lost his or her job from a disability or as a result of the COVID lockdown.\\n\\nWhenever I read or see a government worker \\u2014 be it a politician, nurse, doctor, fireman, policeman, or teacher \\u2014 making such a snobby statement, I feel like asking them who decided that the government should compensate them with a tax-funded $100,000+ per year salary.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact, non-political public sector workers who talk like this aggravate me even more than politicians, because politicians got elected and can be kicked out if we do not like how they are operating.\\n\\nI do not recall a time when any of us could vote on our healthcare professionals, emergency respondents, and teachers to rule over us, nor a means for the public to remove those we do not like.\\n\\nThat is why public sector workers form their own unions and force the state to pay them even higher wages at the expense of the private sector \\u2014 the latter being paid far less than the former.\\n\\nDuring the COVID lockdown, millions of people lost their jobs, homes, and even their lives \\u2014 and I am not talking about COVID itself, but other things, such as suicides, dying from weather exposure after being evicted from their homes, or suffering a health crisis as a consequence that drastically shortened people\\u2019s lives.\\n\\nThe people who lost their jobs were mostly those who had the least economic fallback to begin with \\u2014 cashiers, retail workers, janitors, line cooks, dishwashers, grocery clerks etc..\\n\\nYou know who did not lost their jobs during the COVID lockdown?\\n\\nNurses, physicians, firemen, police officers, teachers, lawyers, transit drivers, public sector office workers, etc..\\n\\nMore or less, the upper classes, who not only got to keep their jobs but who were then able to pillage the vulnerable classes to an even greater extent by taking full advantage of the shattered economic which the state itself engineered by forcing everybody to shut their doors while they made sure that their own salaries would not be impacted.\\n\\nHow many people lost their family businesses because the police \\u2014 who were able to keep their jobs, salaries, bonuses, health coverage, and pensions \\u2014 told them they had no choice, and thus not only impacting the owner but every employee who worked for them?\\n\\nAnd if people could not pay rent, or were so reduced in economic wages that they could not afford an apartment that met whatever \\u201cguidelines\\u201d the municipality imposed?\\n\\nNo problems, the police would just evict them, along with the dozens or hundreds of others who lived in the complex, and throw them onto the street \\u2014 after all, it is so much better to allow these poor doomed tenants to be subjected to weather exposure, gang robberies, and further social stigmatisation.\\n\\nSo, while the politicians and bureaucrats enact legislation that they know would harm the populace far more than it would benefit, while getting their blue-uniformed armed personnel to carry out these grisly deeds before returning to their cozy upper-class houses before returning to work the next day in order to destroy another group of people, the ones they victimised on that day now find themselves potentially facing death from heat, cold, rain, or just psychological misery that is likely to exacerbate any health issues they may already have. [9]\\n\\nBut for the state and its representatives who made that happen?\\n\\nThat is not their problem.\\n\\nWhat is their concern, is how much money THEY can make off the people they make their livings exploiting.\\n\\nThe fact that they put millions of low-income people through economic and mental stress because of government-imposed shutdowns, discrimination, or crooked policy decisiions did not dissuade them from seeing these acts carried out in their entirety.\\n\\nAnd yet, many public sector workers \\u2014 including police officers \\u2014 are fighting for a 10% wage increase, because the $100,000\\u2013120,000 per year they already receive is not good enough for them.\\n\\nOne of the earlier articles I footnoted earlier was a Global News article related to police mental health and decreasing numbers entitled \\u2018What\\u2019s going on is not sustainable\\u2019 while advocating for higher police salaries and mental health services.\\n\\nHere is the reality of the situation: the situation is far less sustainable to the 90% of workers who are getting by on far less \\u2014 some earning as little as a quarter of a police officer\\u2019s wage, while others who are even ess fortunate may be living on part-time minimum-pay employment, or they may even find themselves chronically unemployed.\\n\\nThe mentally ill at the lowest economic level are already the most likely to be jailed, and considering the fact that studies around the world show that poverty significantly increases the types of anxiety and social situations that could put people in those situations, the question becomes why is it that we hire the police to more or less imprison such people, while simultaneously requesting extra taxes to prevent them from falling under the same mental mindset?\\n\\nDoes mental illness only matter when it is a \\u201cprivileged\\u201d member of society?\\n\\nAccording to state and police logic, it is.\\n\\nThat is why a lot of my friends, alongside people I read about in newspapers, documentaries, or word of mouth mutilated themselves, and/or took their own lives in their twenties and early thirties whenever they felt they had nothing more to live for, while others have dealt with chronic depression, PTSD, or a slew of other conditions for which the state neglects them.\\n\\nJustin Trudeau has repeatedly spoken about the rise of \\u201cright-wing extremism\\u201d in Canada \\u2014 apparently ignoring the rise in numbers of those purporting extremist views that fall to the left \\u2014 and how it must be \\u201ccombatted\\u201d.\\n\\nWhat solution does he come up with?\\n\\nBillions of extra funding to be invested into policing and CSIS, because apparently, the state has not done anything to deserve the response from the nameless majority, who may prove far less hostile if the likes of Trudeau would not only ever admit they are wrong, but also proceed to go beyond mere words and put their supposed well-meaning into action by spending more resources on rebuilding the lives of those who have been unfairly impacted at some point by the state\\u2019s legislation and less on the types of agencies that are meant to bring such people down even further.\\n\\nPART TWO \\u2014 SOLUTIONS\\n\\nNow that I have dissected the general problems in our society from a housing shortage perspective, it is time to discuss what I believe must be done if we desire to avoid seeing our country fall into a civil war within the next decade.\\n\\nWhile some of the details may differ, depending on whether the occupants are living in urban, suburban, or rural residents, my general recommendation is to provide square footage of approximately 500 square feet of apartment space for singles, up to 1,000 square feet of apartment space for two or more residents, and coop houses of around 1,000 square feet for larger families and groups.\\n\\nThese suggestions are based on thousands of apartment designs I have studied both locally and internationally \\u2014 sometimes visiting them in person \\u2014 over the years, in order to come up with the most cost-efficient units that can be built without jeopardising a person\\u2019s self-esteem.\\n\\nThe most common and practical layout for a 500-square-foot apartment I have seen has visitors and tenants entering through a main doorway, with a closet immediately to the right for outdoor wear, a kitchen to the right, the living room at the far end, with a small washroom either to the left or right, and a small balcony to go with it.\\n\\nFor smaller living room spaces, those 500-square-foot apartments included a small bedroom.\\n\\nLarger residents were often similar, only the living room space was made slightly longer and wide, with a second bedroom to go with it \\u2014 ideal if two low-income tenants choose to reside together.\\n\\nMany such apartment buildings \\u2014 even low-rise ones \\u2014 also include small storage units for items that a tenant may not regular use indoors, such as sport equipment, hand tools, and holiday decorations.\\n\\nSeeing as investing in storage is a paltry sum of money compared to various other services that even conservative supporters defend, I do not think giving low-income tenants even this extra space would be too much of a burden on taxpayers.\\n\\nWhat is more, is that once an apartment or coop house is built, it has the potential to last for at least fifty, or even a hundred years without requiring any serious renovation, meaning that even after a tenant becomes financially better off and moves out, or they should die before doing so, this would leave a unit vacant for somebody else to come around.\\n\\nOnce a building is built, inflation no longer becomes an issue, just as a stack of food cans physically in your storage will remain accessible, regardless of your personal finances.\\n\\nSince I know that selling this to the \\u201cconservative\\u201d crowd would be much more difficult to achieve than the \\u201cliberals\\u201d, I suppose I should mention why I believe this would benefit them:\\n\\n * Employers would no longer need to pay minimum wage \\u2014 a concept was originally introduced so that workers could have a livable working salary; a necessity that would no longer be present if low-income people were directly funded by the state through the provision of physical living spaces to reside in, reasonable food budget, utilities, internet, easily accessible state-provided public transport\\n * Lower crime rates would mean less need for other multi-billion dollar investments related to incarcerating and/or institutionalising these marginalised groups\\n * Employees may suffer less burnout at work, and thus be far more physically productive\\nIn addition to the housing aspect, the introduction of the concept of \\u201cguaranteed jobs\\u201d is another feature that I feel to be both realistic and complementary to this solution.\\n\\nWhat this means, is that low-income people who are struggling to find traditional work can earn an allowance in addition to the provided essentials by \\u201cvolunteering\\u201d in these areas:\\n\\n * Community service \\u2014 whether it be picking up garbage, cutting grass, shovelling snow, tidying up a state-sponsored apartment building or coop house, either for the city or for a disabled person\\n * Recognised non-profit sector \\u2014 this can include fundraising and/or personally assisting in a non-profit organisation that helps members of a community\\n * Artistic field \\u2014 this can include assisting a company or state in the production of a state-recognised project, such as film, animation, video games, music, landscaping, and even invention (individuals with a state-recognised portfolio can also apply to self-employ themselves in this sector, provided that they agree to certain regulations, such as making their product partially or entirely available to the public without charge, depending on the cost of service, and the amount of allowance the state sponsors)\\n * Self-employment \\u2014 those who wish to run a small independent business, can submit some of their works as proof of labour intended to benefit the community in any way, shape, or form, and in turn get an allowance, with the assumption that a certain number of hours per week would be spent working in the requested field, and that either the products would be provided free of charge, or be partially subsidised, depending on the cost of the products, and the amount of allowance the state has chosen to provide\\n * Education \\u2014 those who are studying in a field that does require some formal education, such as medicine, engineering, articling, or post-secondary teaching, or those who are given permission on an individual basis to study in an optional course or degree can also be given an allowance, provided that certain regulations are met, such as the number of hours of studying per week to be completed, as well as end-term grades\\nWhat is the reasoning for this, and how will this save money?\\n\\nEthics aside, the economic advantages here, are that people would be doing something community-productive, even if these are not the jobs that one traditionally thinks.\\n\\nIn a work-world of increasing automation, it is no longer reasonable to assume that factories or other traditionally labour intensive sectors will provide hundreds of people a working-class salary when robotics has proven more economically beneficial.\\n\\nWhere do these workers go?\\n\\nDo they just sit around in an apartment all day twiddling their thumbs, and questioning their livelihood, or do we encourage them back into the workforce by means other than threats of eviction?\\n\\nI think the latter is better, and I would rather see these people earning slightly more tax money by investing their time like everybody else, as opposed to paying them less, and having them sitting idly back at home.\\n\\nNon-profit and artistic sector employment jobs would also benefit from this, as would low-income private sector businesses, because they would have otherwise non-available employees working for them, and it would be the state who would be supplying all, or at least part of this working fee.\\n\\nThis would mean the difference between vital non-profit agencies and independent businesses failing, or making it, and actually having a fighting chance against some of the bigger corporations.\\n\\nBeing a disabled person myself who has nonetheless done various volunteer work jobs in my life, including retail, assistant coaching, charity fundraising, security, proofreading, tutoring, content creation, and even altar service, I cannot imagine I would be less willing to work if I got paid for my services.\\n\\nInterestingly enough, aside from some income I get from traditional work, the state currently gives me approximately $15,000 per year to spend freely on everything from activities, entertainment, and even education (the last one excluding university and college programmes) through a local non-profit agency, plus extra rental to subsidise my basic housing needs.\\n\\nWhile I understand that some people who are particularly afflicted by crippling mental and/or physical conditions may not be able to work, I do not believe this is the case for me, as well as others, and I would be far happier if the $15,000 per year provided to me for \\u201crecreational activities\\u201d was instead given to me as a working allowance of the variety described earlier, assuming that the basic housing provisions, as well as the extra side income I am already earning were included.\\n\\nAfter all, if the state can afford to give the likes of me an average of $15,000 per year to spend on more activities than I can come up with, they can definitely give recipients who want employment and the ability to use their income the way they want an option to change their financial setting to something closer to the above paragraph\\u2019s description.\\n\\nThis would make it easier for me to find volunteer work at locations that are not currently hiring, due to financial reasons, and improve my work experience, self-esteem, and be of service to a non-profit or low-income business that would otherwise be inoperable.\\n\\nAnd lastly, another solution that I have spoken about in great detail in several of my earlier answers, is state-funded public transport.\\n\\nNot only would this limit the needs for hiring transit police just to inspect people\\u2019s tickets, it would also decrease the amount of traffic, fuel wastage, and road repairs caused by vehicular activity.\\n\\nThe public transportation system \\u2014 which would include municipal buses and trains \\u2014 would then be expanded to fund inter-regional transportation intending to take passengers from one city, town, village, or farmland to another in as little time as possible.\\n\\nWhat this would do, is expand both housing and employment opportunities not only for the poor, but also for the middle and upper-classes.\\n\\nMany people live in downtrodden city apartments because jobs are scarce in rural areas, despite housing and rental costs being cheaper there.\\n\\nIf these same workers were given access to a public inter-regional train that would take them to their workplace in the city, and back to their home in the rural regions at night within a reasonable time, a person working retail full-time may still be able to afford a private apartment or small house, and not even require living in a state-funded apartment.\\n\\nIn other words, this system \\u2014 while perhaps costly upfront \\u2014 would take far more people off government assistance of any kind, and also reduce tensions that can cause health and crime-related issues to flare up.\\n\\nConservatives say they love saving money.\\n\\nIf they believe that what I have said is erroneous, then let them speak.\\n\\nLiberals may perhaps say the same thing when it comes to my opposing views on university tuition or other social issues.\\n\\nI also respectfully ask that they step forward right now, and let everybody know how wrong I am.\\n\\nThe only way for our society to progress is to be able to see the strengths and flaws of everybody, including ourselves, and that first step, starts at the debating table.\\n\\n\\n1.

There was so much local opposition they couldn\\u2019t get approval. The new library branch is there now.\\n\\nThe library used to be in the mall they tore down. No new housing their either. Just a plaza.\\n\\nAnd pretty much all the suggested solutions are clearly inadequate. For example, building on unoccupied or underoccupied city land is one good idea. I think there are a couple of dozen sites in the whole city.\\n\\nBut it\\u2019s clear that the GTA is short on large apartment buildings\\n\\n * About 800,000 people in the GTA live in a building of more than five storys. About 70% of those are in the City of Toronto proper although only about 40% of the population lives in the City proper.\\n * 60% of the people in the GTA live in a household with 1 or 2 people.\\nAnd about the only thing that the Ford government has done is allow increased densities\\u2026. where there are already high densities. That means no new apartment buildings out in Rexdale where he lives.\\n\\nLike I said, it\\u2019s going to be expensive. More transit. Higher densities throughout the GTA (which means overruling local councils) particularly near existing transit. Ending transit balkanization would help (although Montreal has this problem too - Vancouver doesn\\u2019t)\\n\\nRight now, Milton is on pace to become the 16th largest municipality in Canada by 2030 - the third largest in the GTA after Toronto and Mississauga. All the development there is single family homes. There are apartments, but they\\u2019re just as expensive as the ones in Toronto.\\n\\nNo government sees this as it\\u2019s problem. Ottawa sees housing as a provincial problem even though Ottawa is growing by leaps and bounds too. Ontario sees this as a \\u201cToronto\\u201d problem, not a GTA problem. Toronto\\u2019s not helping - it\\u2019s development history is slow and backwards looking. The GTA municipalities don\\u2019t see why they should address the problem, and they\\u2019re full of single family home owners who hate apartments on the horizon. The rest of the province doesn\\u2019t want provincial taxes to go to Toronto.\", \"upvoteCount\": 13, \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/Do-you-agree-that-there-is-a-housing-crisis-in-Canada-as-Canadian-Prime-Minister-Justin-Trudeau-suggested-during-his-retreat-in-London-Ontario?top_ans=146182582\"}, {\"@type\": \"Answer\", \"author\": {\"@type\": \"Person\", \"agentInteractionStatistic\": {\"@type\": \"InteractionCounter\", \"interactionType\": \"http://schema.org/ReplyAction\", \"userInteractionCount\": 103}, \"image\": \"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-2047775780-100-ghocezvjinmdaimqrzgjfdugyaigqxui.jpeg\", \"interactionStatistic\": {\"@type\": \"InteractionCounter\", \"interactionType\": \"http://schema.org/FollowAction\", \"userInteractionCount\": 15}, \"name\": \"Dave Galloway\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/profile/Dave-Galloway-34\"}, \"dateCreated\": \"2024-02-27T01:16:27.753081+00:00\", \"parentItem\": {\"@type\": \"Comment\", \"text\": \"How can Trudeau actually be fighting the housing crisis if he increased the number of immigrants he brings in?\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/How-can-Trudeau-actually-be-fighting-the-housing-crisis-if-he-increased-the-number-of-immigrants-he-brings-in\"}, \"text\": \"it is the responsibility of the provinces & municipalities to increase housing.

Do none of these politicians ever study first year economics? You know, the basics of supply a demand? Here\\u2019s the TL:DR. Increase supply, and prices fall. Increase demand, and prices rise.\\n\\nAny policy, therefore, which makes it easier for people to buy a house will increase demand. So the proposals to introduce a TFSA for homes, and to reduceCMHC insurance costs, will make it easier in the short run to afford a home, but will therefore increase demand. As did earlier policies such as 30 year mortgages and lower down payment requirements. On the other hand the governments earlier policy of increasing the \\u201cstress test\\u201d decreased demand, although it didn\\u2019t increase supply. The new policy to increase \\u201crent to buy\\u201d will have a similar, but lesser, effect.\\n\\nIn short, it becomes a vicious circle. Giving people money to buy homes, or rules which means needing less money to get into the market (which includes, obviously, interest rate policies) may appear, on the face of it, to allow people into the market, but in the medium to long term simply reinforces the upward forces on price as demand increases.\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s required is to either reduce demand or increase supply. The former, though common around the world where rental is the rule to a greater extent, is tough in country with huge amounts of vacant land and where ownership of land is a fundamental dream. Generations of immigrants came here and invested in houses because, as they knew from their own experience in crowded Europe and Asia, God isn\\u2019t increasing the supply of land. Convincing Canadians that the single family home with a 50 foot plot of grass shouldn\\u2019t be a goal will be tough.\\n\\nWhich means increasing supply is the solution. The proposal to repair and renovate old properties works, as does the Conservative plan to convert unused government holdings to residential. Taxes are a huge aspect - few people realize what\\u2019s involved in buying a new home - that is, a newly constructed one that adds to the supply. If you buy a $900,000 new home in Toronto, for example, you will pay $107,000 in HST alone. Plus $12,000 in provincial land transfer tax, and a similar amount in Toronto land transfer tax. Plus the development charges, which are fees imposed by the municipality for permits, legal and so one, often in the $25,000-$50,000 range in cities. No one has $150000 in cash to drop down just for taxes in a house, so buyers have to add that to their mortgage, on which they will pay interest for the next 20 or 30 years. That\\u2019s a massive disincentive for new homes, when re-sale homes don\\u2019t include an HST component. It\\u2019s much cheaper to buy from existing stock than to purchase a new house.\\n\\nAllowing \\u201cin-law\\u201d suites is another solution, as is relaxing rules for infill. Another would be to focus on policies which encourage people to move away from places like Toronto and Vancouver by improving transportation links from there to other cities like North Bay and Ottawa or the Okanogan and Vancouver Island. And yet another is one called for by developers for years - decrease red tape. In Ottawa, which I am familiar with, it takes years of planning approvals and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees to get approvals for projects. Apart from the delay, it means that for the most part, only large, established companies are in the game. Small builders haven\\u2019t a hope of doing more than a couple or so houses a year. Cronyism is real - there are a certain number of planners at City Hall, and getting to know your planner well is a huge advantage.\\n\\nAnyway, long and short - offering people money buys votes, but makes the problem worse. Reducing government taxes on new builds and reducing red tape helps. Increase supply, prices go down.\", \"upvoteCount\": 6, \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/Do-you-agree-that-there-is-a-housing-crisis-in-Canada-as-Canadian-Prime-Minister-Justin-Trudeau-suggested-during-his-retreat-in-London-Ontario?top_ans=304039253\"}, {\"@type\": \"Answer\", \"author\": {\"@type\": \"Person\", \"agentInteractionStatistic\": {\"@type\": \"InteractionCounter\", \"interactionType\": \"http://schema.org/ReplyAction\", \"userInteractionCount\": 21740}, \"description\": \"former Canadian Army Officer and HR Manager\", \"hasOccupation\": {\"@type\": \"Role\", \"roleName\": \"Canadian Army Officer and HR Manager\"}, \"image\": \"\", \"interactionStatistic\": {\"@type\": \"InteractionCounter\", \"interactionType\": \"http://schema.org/FollowAction\", \"userInteractionCount\": 2262}, \"name\": \"Robert Crooks\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/profile/Robert-Crooks-8\"}, \"dateCreated\": \"2023-08-30T20:55:35.264130+00:00\", \"parentItem\": {\"@type\": \"Comment\", \"text\": \"Why can\\u2019t Canada build thousands of apartment towers and solve the housing crisis?\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/Why-can-t-Canada-build-thousands-of-apartment-towers-and-solve-the-housing-crisis\"}, \"text\": \"A2A.\\n\\nWe can, but, historically, the big cities where the problems are, have limited huge segments of the cities to single-family dwellings.

Until it finally bursts. Real estate market is not as volatile as stock market. It will heat up over a long period of time and even the bursting of the bubble takes a long time (mostly because most property owners do not want to admit defeat. they go into denial that the trend is downward until a powerful external stimuli hit the market psyche). Therefore, the bursting of a real estate bubble always happens rapidly and dramatically. It will for sure always be a guaranteed panic sell. The thing is real estate asset is not a very liquid asset. In a downward market, no one wants to buy. If you own a stock, you can lower the asking price and liquidate it. Someone will be willing to buy it if the price is low enough. Real estate you can\\u2019t do that.\\n\\nThis is related to human psychology : FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) and herd mentality. An example of this is bitcoin. I got into bitcoin two summers ago.

You see sometimes there are no cars in the 3rd or 4th lane and that lane actually becomes the fast lane. Once you see a driver or two getting into the 1st lane, you feel like there is something special about that lane. It gives you the illusion that somehow if you get on that lane, you could drive from Montreal to Toronto in 3 hours.

If you buy a $900,000 new home in Toronto, for example, you will pay $107,000 in HST alone. Plus $12,000 in provincial land transfer tax, and a similar amount in Toronto land transfer tax. Plus the development charges, which are fees imposed by the municipality for permits, legal and so one, often in the $25,000-$50,000 range in cities.

They discontinued one of my BP meds and all has been fine.\\n\\nMy sister-in-law was living with us and developed lung cancer. Once it was known that she could tolerate the chemo, they sent it to the local hospital so she didn\\u2019t have to travel.\\n\\nToward the end, she was getting a home care nurse every two days to change the dressings on her secondary tumours.\\n\\nEventually, she got really bad and we called 911 in the middle of the night 0n New Years Day. The ambulance was literally in the driveway before my wife hung up with the 911 operator.\\n\\nA couple of weeks ago, we called 911 when my wife had excruciating pain after stepping in a depression in our driveway. We were worried she might have broken a hip. From the time we called the ambulance, she got to hospital (which apologised for being short-handed and busy), she had an x-ray, seen a doctor who assured her that there was nothing broken, (probably a pulled hamstring), received a big shot of anti-inflammatory, been picked up by me and arrived back home, it was less than three hours.\\n\\nSo, as I said, it has served us well.\", \"upvoteCount\": 21, \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/What-would-you-change-about-healthcare-in-Toronto?top_ans=401922282\"}, {\"@type\": \"Answer\", \"author\": {\"@type\": \"Person\", \"agentInteractionStatistic\": {\"@type\": \"InteractionCounter\", \"interactionType\": \"http://schema.org/ReplyAction\", \"userInteractionCount\": 55389}, \"description\": \"Long time Common Sense Canadian Conservative\", \"image\": \"https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-156657358-100-fggxpgivdjmcybslrcqzzsgzqwhsrtbo.jpeg\", \"interactionStatistic\": {\"@type\": \"InteractionCounter\", \"interactionType\": \"http://schema.org/FollowAction\", \"userInteractionCount\": 11904}, \"knowsAbout\": \"Canadian Conservatve\", \"name\": \"Mike Webster\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/profile/Mike-Webster-22\"}, \"dateCreated\": \"2021-10-13T17:53:07.869198+00:00\", \"parentItem\": {\"@type\": \"Comment\", \"text\": \"How bad is Canada's healthcare system given that it\\u2019s free?\", \"url\": \"https://www.quora.com/How-bad-is-Canadas-healthcare-system-given-that-it-s-free?no_redirect=1\"}, \"text\": \"So much fail in such a short question.

To wit, start building more streetcar lines (similar to what the old Transit City plan [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_City ] was).\\n\\nDo not think you\\u2019ll improve the lives of low rent areas with a subway line extension or a new street car line. Face reality whether you build street car lines or subway lines, property along those lines will become target for development (i,e., condos) and will price out renters. The best thing to do is give transit deserts dedicated bus ways. Rich people and the young, educated, and aspirational will pay a premium to live on a subway or street car line, they won\\u2019t pay a premium to take a bus. You can greatly improve their lives by giving them reliable and frequent bus service.\\n\\nSell naming and air rights to new and existing subway stations. I\\u2019m not tied to St. Clair West as as subway station name. I don\\u2019t care if it\\u2019s renamed the Samsung subway station. If Samsung pays a premium and pays to keep the station clean, even better. Let developers build condo projects right above new and existing subway stations (where possible). For the right to be able to sell a condo with the convenience of \\u201can elevator ride down to the subway\\u201d, the developer has to build the station (if new) or pay for renovations. The building/condo corporation is also responsible in perpetuity for the cleaning and upkeep of the station.\\n\\nRealize there\\u2019s no solution to the reality that most people, given a choice, want to live in the downtown steps away from their job in the downtown. If you have more people wanting to live on a plot of land then there are spaces for them, there\\u2019s no law that will provide affordable condos, homes, and apartments for everyone who wants to partake of a lifestyle choice. That\\u2019s simple economics. London, New York, San Francisco, Vancouver, Miami, Washington D.C., etc. have never found a solution to this problem. Toronto should abandon the notion it will magically find a solution.\\n\\nEvery time a condo project goes up in the downtown people complain \\u201coh, not another condo!\\u201d Yet they also complain about Toronto rents. Accept you have to build density if you want to even start to try alleviating high rents.\\n\\nPeople want to live in the downtown, largely, because the current transit system is broken, horribly. There are lower rent areas in Toronto but people don\\u2019t want to live there because they face a daily nightmare commute. It can take, for example, two hours ONE WAY commuting on public transit from Scarborough. People will pay higher rents for the lower stress of being able to walk to work. Again, develop better street car lines to ferry people into the core.\\n\\nFind ways to encourage reverse commutes. Subways come packed southbound and head northbound half empty. The thought of \\u201cworking north of Bloor\\u201d is just horrifying to some. Hence, lots of technology companies won\\u2019t even open an office in, say, North York or Vaughan for fear they won\\u2019t get workers.

When the snow melts, you see a lot of litter, unfortunately. People need to be more conscious and use the 92,000 litter dispensers across the city. Now the clean up is done after the winter, and the city is so beautiful during spring, summer and fall.

The traffic during rush hour can be a nightmare. We need to improve the public transit system so more people can take it and less people drive cars. During the winter, the snow covers a lot of stuff. When the snow melts, you see a lot of litter, unfortunately. People need to be more conscious and use the 92,000 litter dispensers across the city. Now the clean up is done after the winter, and the city is so beautiful during spring, summer and fall. I also think that we could use the downtown space on the Lake for more public places and not just glass condos. The condos look spectacular across the skyline but we need more shops, restaurants, people spaces on the Lake - we don’t take advantage of it. Those are my thoughts for now!

The average home price in the country is $650,000, and don’t expect to find a house in that price range in the City of Toronto (except maybe a small condo, and that most likely means your maintenance fees will be $1,000 a month). So, assuming you can save up $130,000 for a down payment (good luck with that). For that, you would need an income of $91,000 to qualify. If the house price is just a tad over $1 million, you can’t get a guaranteed loan for that, so your interest rate goes up sharply.\n",

The addition of new rental units in the last 40 years or so has been glacial. This isn’t some problem with rent control - on most land in Canada, municipal law prohibits apartment buildings unless they have massive amounts of parking around them. In some areas, you can’t build them at all. There are often requirements to have unused “green space” around them as well, which is completely underutilized.\n",

More recently, particularly during summer, the city has been closing more streets to traffic, turning them into pedestrian malls. You can do this without a lot of disruption to traffic, which just goes around. You can have more dense housing as long as they don’t all need a car, and they won’t need a car if they can walk, bike or take transit to where they need to go. That’s the solution.\n",

This is typical development in Toronto.\n",

            "Now, here in Ontario, the provincial government has allowed municipalities to have denser zoning. The thing is, they refuse to do it because it’s unpopular with people who are likely to vote in municipal elections.

However, attempts to take it “the next step”, which are supported by most local residents and the area’s councilor, have not found favour at city council. As such, this densely packed area is cut in two by a six-lane arterial road. I have to cross that street from time to time and there are certain places I won’t even attempt to cross because of turning traffic. There was a proposal to narrow the road to four lanes (which is the width of the street a couple of kilometers south) and to add a bike lane and wider sidewalks. It didn’t get any support because many people who don’t live in the area drive through it to get to the nearby 401 highway.\n",

            "As such, it doesn’t matter how much money the federal government pours into the problem - the types of buildings it needs to built to make housing affordable and cost effective can’t be built anywhere in the city or anywhere near it. In addition, people like me who live in densely packed areas are actually subsidizing people who live in spread out suburbs, at all three levels of government. There’s no incentive for people in suburbs to encourage denser development, which results in more tax revenue, because they don’t bear the full burden of that tax deficit - downtown dwellers do.\n",

The rest of the province doesn’t want provincial taxes to go to Toronto.\n",

            "Any policy, therefore, which makes it easier for people to buy a house will increase demand. So the proposals to introduce a TFSA for homes, and to reduceCMHC insurance costs, will make it easier in the short run to afford a home, but will therefore increase demand. As did earlier policies such as 30 year mortgages and lower down payment requirements. On the other hand the governments earlier policy of increasing the “stress test” decreased demand, although it didn’t increase supply. The new policy to increase “rent to buy” will have a similar, but lesser, effect.\n",

            "In short, it becomes a vicious circle. Giving people money to buy homes, or rules which means needing less money to get into the market (which includes, obviously, interest rate policies) may appear, on the face of it, to allow people into the market, but in the medium to long term simply reinforces the upward forces on price as demand increases.\n",
            "\n",
            "What’s required is to either reduce demand or increase supply. The former, though common around the world where rental is the rule to a greater extent, is tough in country with huge amounts of vacant land and where ownership of land is a fundamental dream. Generations of immigrants came here and invested in houses because, as they knew from their own experience in crowded Europe and Asia, God isn’t increasing the supply of land. Convincing Canadians that the single family home with a 50 foot plot of grass shouldn’t be a goal will be tough.\n",
            "\n",
            "Which means increasing supply is the solution. The proposal to repair and renovate old properties works, as does the Conservative plan to convert unused government holdings to residential. Taxes are a huge aspect - few people realize what’s involved in buying a new home - that is, a newly constructed one that adds to the supply. If you buy a $900,000 new home in Toronto, for example, you will pay $107,000 in HST alone. Plus $12,000 in provincial land transfer tax, and a similar amount in Toronto land transfer tax. Plus the development charges, which are fees imposed by the municipality for permits, legal and so one, often in the $25,000-$50,000 range in cities. No one has $150000 in cash to drop down just for taxes in a house, so buyers have to add that to their mortgage, on which they will pay interest for the next 20 or 30 years. That’s a massive disincentive for new homes, when re-sale homes don’t include an HST component. It’s much cheaper to buy from existing stock than to purchase a new house.\n",
            "\n",
            "Allowing “in-law” suites is another solution, as is relaxing rules for infill. Another would be to focus on policies which encourage people to move away from places like Toronto and Vancouver by improving transportation links from there to other cities like North Bay and Ottawa or the Okanogan and Vancouver Island. And yet another is one called for by developers for years - decrease red tape. In Ottawa, which I am familiar with, it takes years of planning approvals and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees to get approvals for projects. Apart from the delay, it means that for the most part, only large, established companies are in the game. Small builders haven’t a hope of doing more than a couple or so houses a year. Cronyism is real - there are a certain number of planners at City Hall, and getting to know your planner well is a huge advantage.\n",
            "\n",
            "Anyway, long and short - offering people money buys votes, but makes the problem worse. Reducing government taxes on new builds and reducing red tape helps. Increase supply, prices go down.\n",

It will heat up over a long period of time and even the bursting of the bubble takes a long time (mostly because most property owners do not want to admit defeat. they go into denial that the trend is downward until a powerful external stimuli hit the market psyche). Therefore, the bursting of a real estate bubble always happens rapidly and dramatically. It will for sure always be a guaranteed panic sell. The thing is real estate asset is not a very liquid asset. In a downward market, no one wants to buy. If you own a stock, you can lower the asking price and liquidate it. Someone will be willing to buy it if the price is low enough. Real estate you can’t do that.\n",

            "Canada alone cannot fix this. The needle to pop the bubble has to come from external pressure. It is ultimately the US Federal Reserve, Wall Street old boy network, investment bankers and with the added input of voters around the major countries that decisions are made. Decides whether these times are for making money or keeping money safe.\n",
            "There is lots of land allocated for housing in Canada, just not in the vicinity of Vancouver or Toronto. Go to Medicine Hat or Moose Jaw and you can get a quarter acre building lot dirt cheap.\n",
            "\n",
            "Better move fast because the average house price in Moose Jaw skyrocketed to nearly $240,000 last year. That’s still pretty average for Canada, though. You have probably missed the window of opportunity for the Maritime Provinces as people flocked there from Toronto to telecommute, and drove up house prices to 1/3 of what they are in Toronto.\n",

            "The housing crisis exists only in the minds of people living in or near a couple of major cities, and people who voted for the current Liberal government. The 70% of people who didn’t vote Liberal live in much cheaper places.\n",

            "If you insist in living in a large city with a population over 1 million, Edmonton is probably your best choice because house prices are 1/3 of Toronto and 1/4 of Vancouver since it is surrounded by a near infinite amount of flat land available for development. There is no agricultural land reserve because the prime agricultural land runs from Edmonton to the Saskatchewan border - and on the other side there is even more of it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Average wages are much higher in Edmonton than either of Toronto and Vancouver, but you have to put up with a lot of blue collar workers driving around in big, expensive, pickup trucks from their big houses to their high paying industrial jobs. However, there are also lots of ethnic restaurants and cultural events to go to, and the schools are better than most other cities. If immigrants want their kids to go to a publicly supported Hindu or Muslim or Mandarin school, there they are.\n",
            "Yes. The federal government believes we need to grow the population so they’re bringing in upwards of 500,000 immigrants a year, plus asylum seekers and refugees . These people all need somewhere to live plus the natural increase in our own Canadian population.\n",

            "The provincial governments have decreed things like turning people who would otherwise be housed in for instance, long-term care, or mental institutions out on the streets. They’re not providing support for the people who are hard to house, and what they provide is inadequate. They instead provide money to third-party ‘charity’ organizations who have no overarching authority to really solve the problem.\n",
            "\n",
            "The municipalities engage in a lot of not in my backyard, thinking and planning, and I’m not sure if there’s a municipality in the country that can get a building permit for you in less than a year. If you want to build rental housing it’s probably double that. If you want to build a modern green building and include things like solar panels or a green roof or gray water recycling chances are it drags out the building permit process even further\n",
